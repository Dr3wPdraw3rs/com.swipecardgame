## [Interactive Header](https://github.com/zayadur/com.swipecardgame/tree/main/InteractiveHeader): an interactive demonstration of how the game works.
Users are asked to "swipe left" or "swipe right" on a combination of cards representing a dating profile a la using Tinder.

### How was it done?
Refer to `/InteractiveHeader/script.js`
1. Create an array of `cards` and initialize an array to represent the player's `deck`.
2. Add `cards` to the `deck`.
3. `render()` renders 3 cards from the deck and creates HTML objects.
4. `shuffle()` randomly shuffles the deck to display a random set.
5. A window event listener loads these functions on page load.
